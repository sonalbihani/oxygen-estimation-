# Spatiotemporal Oxygen Estimation from Land Cover using SVM and Image Processing

### Forest cover detection and identifying change in forest area
The LANDSAT images are used to identify the land cover over
urban, semi-urban and forest areas to determine the change in
the vegetation over a period of 15-20 years.
### Plant classification and determining chlorophyll and nitrogen
content
Flavia dataset is used to train the neural network which aims to
recognise leaves for plant classification. This is useful as when
analysing the satellite images of urban, semi-urban and forest
areas we can identify the rare flora species and specifically work
for their conservation. The chlorophyll and nitrogen estimation
using RGB and HSV values will help in estimation of the
overall oxygen production of a given area over a period of time.
### Calculation of oxygen production and hence determining the
overall changes in global oxygen production
The change in oxygen production of a region will give us an
insight into the loss/ gain of vegetation over the years as they are
direct indicators of each other. This can further be applied to
urban planning and can help in conserving the forest lands and
endangered fauna.
